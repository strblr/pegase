Pegase is the last PEG parser generator for JavaScript and TypeScript you will ever need to learn. It's:

- **_Inline_**, meaning parsing expressions and grammars are directly expressed in-code as [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates). No generation step, no CLI. Pegase works in complete symbiosis with JS. As an example, [`RegExp`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) can directly be part of grammars via tag arguments.
- **_Lightweight_**. Pegase is a _zero-dependency_ package, and weights less than 7kB gzipped.
- **_Intuitive_**, in that it lets you express complex grammars and semantic actions in simple ways and with excellent error reporting, warnings, error recovery, [cut operator](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1269/paper232.pdf), grammar fragments, and a lot more.
- **_Highly extensible_**: You can define your own `Parser` subclasses, add plugins, write custom directives, etc.

## Overview

### Motivation

The first and main goal of this library is to get you quickly and painlessly into parsing. Let's take a look at an example: parsing math expressions. With very few lines of code, some directives and semantic actions, you already have a parser that also acts as a _calculator_:

```js
import peg from "pegase";

function calc(left, op, right) {
  switch (op) {
    case "+": return left + right;
    case "-": return left - right;
    case "*": return left * right;
    case "/": return left / right;
  }
}

const g = peg`  
  expr: term % ("+" | "-") @infix(${calc})  
  term: fact % ("*" | "/") @infix(${calc})  
  fact: num | '(' expr ')'
  num @token("integer"):
    '-'? [0-9]+ @number
`;
```

A few early notes here :

- `a % b` is a shortcut for `a (b a)*`, meaning _"any sequence of `a` separated by `b`"_.
- You can think of parsers as black boxes *emitting* (if they succeed) zero or more values, called `children`. These black boxes can be composed together to form more complex parsers.
- `@infix` is a directive. It transforms a parser's `children` by treating them as items of an infix expression and reducing them to a single child using the provided callback.
- `@number` is another directive. It takes the raw match, converts it into a number and emits that number as a single child.
- By default, whitespace skipping is automatically handled without you having to tweak a single thing. It's entirely configurable of course.
- Notice how some literals are single-quoted like `')'` or double-quoted like `"+"`. Double-quote literals emit their string match as a single child, while single-quotes are silent. Writing the operators with double quotes allows them to be accumulated and processed in `@infix`.

Let's see how this plays out :

#### `g.parse("2 + (17-2*30) *(-5)+2").value`

```json
219
```

#### `g.parse("2* (4 + )/32").success`

```json
false
```

#### `g.parse("2* (4 + )/32").logs()`

```
(1:9) Failure: Expected integer or "("

> 1 | 2* (4 + )/32
    |         ^
```

Don't worry if things aren't so clear yet. The rest of the documentation below is here to go step by step in all the underlying concepts, so that you understand the core philosophy and principles at hand.

### Quick start

First, add pegase as a dependency:

`npm install pegase` or `yarn add pegase`

Next, import the template literal tag that will become your new best friend and there you go, ready to write your first parsing expression.

```js
import peg from "pegase";

const parser = peg`your pegase expression`;
```

What about a parser that recognizes a binary digit ? That's a simple alternative:

```js
const bit = peg`'0' | '1'`;
```

Ok, `bit` is now a `Parser` instance, which has 4 methods : `parse`, `test`, `value` and `children`. Let's take a look at `test`. It takes a string input and returns `true` or `false` (whether the string conforms to the pattern or not).

```js
if (bit.test("1"))
  console.log("It matches!");
```

What about an array of bits like `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]` ?

```js
const bitArray = peg`'[' ('0' | '1') % ',' ']'`
```

The `%` operator can be read as "separated by". Let's test it:

```js
if (bitArray.test(" [ 0,1 ,0  ,  1, 1]  "))
  console.log("It matches!");
```

As you might have spotted, whitespaces are handled automatically by default (it can be changed). The way this works is pretty simple: whitespace characters and comments are parsed and discarded **before every terminal expression** (like `'['`, `'1'`, etc.). This process is called **skipping**. By default, every parser also adds an implicit "end of input" symbol (`$`) at the end of the parsing expression and treats it as a terminal, thus the trailing space is also skipped and the whole string matches.

Good, but so far, a `RegExp` could have done the job. Things get interesting when we add in **non-terminals**. A non-terminal is an identifier that refers to a more complex parsing expression which will be invoked every time the identifier is used. You can think of non-terminals as variables whose value is a parser, initialized in what we call `rules`. This allows for recursive patterns. Let's say we want to match possibly infinitely-nested bit arrays:

```js
const nestedBitArray = peg`  
  bitArray: '[' (bit | bitArray) % ',' ']'
  bit: '0' | '1'
`;
```

We have two rules: `bitArray` and `bit`. A collection of rules is called a **grammar**. `nestedBitArray` always points to the topmost rule, `bitArray`.

Testing it:

```js
nestedBitArray.test("[[0]"); // false
nestedBitArray.test("[ [1, 0], 1] "); // true
nestedBitArray.test(" [0, [[0] ]]"); // true
```

Fun fact: if we already defined `bit` as a JS variable, we're not obligated to redefine it as a rule. We can simply inject it as a tag argument:

```js
const nestedBitArray = peg`  
  bitArray: '[' (${bit} | bitArray) % ',' ']'
`;
```

## Basic concepts

### Building parsers

Here are the different expressions you can use as building blocks of arbitrarily complex parsing expressions (in the following examples, `e` represents any parsing expression of higher precedence):

### Dataflow

PEG parsers are top-down parsers, meaning the parsing expressions are recursively traversed (or *"called"*) in a depth-first manner, guided by a left-to-right input read. This traversal process can be represented as a tree, called concrete syntax tree. In fact, a top-down parsing process can be thought of as an attempt to build such tree. Let's illustrate that with the following grammar:

```js
const prefix = peg`
  expr: op expr expr | \d
  op: '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
`;
```

The input `"+ 5 2"` would generate the following concrete syntax tree:
